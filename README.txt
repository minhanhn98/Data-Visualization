Adding Depth to Data

An application that could process a set of data and then offer an audio representation of the data. The user would supply a set of data and select an interval to "play" their data. Then while their data is plotted on screen an audio is played that adjust its pitch/volume to represent each data point. Additional features could include colors running on screen at the same time to represent the rates of change in the data, and a search function that could set off a certain audio queues during playback at any specific data point.
